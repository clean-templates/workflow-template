# Workflow Template

Web applications can often involve complex workflows that span across multiple systems and stages. Long workflow processes can involve multiple tasks, approvals, and stakeholders, making them difficult to manage without a proper system in place. A well-designed workflow management system can help simplify the process, ensuring that each task is completed on time and that all stakeholders are informed about the progress of the workflow. It can also help improve efficiency by automating repetitive tasks, reducing the chances of errors, and ensuring that everything is done in a timely and organized manner.

# Spring Boot Technology

Spring Boot is a popular web application framework that provides developers with a set of tools and libraries for building web applications. It is known for its simplicity and ease of use, allowing developers to quickly build and deploy applications without having to worry about the underlying infrastructure. Spring Boot provides a range of features, such as auto-configuration, which reduces the amount of boilerplate code required to set up an application. It also provides a powerful dependency injection system, making it easy to manage dependencies and test applications. Spring Boot is well-suited for building web applications with long workflow processes, as it provides a solid foundation for building scalable and robust systems.

# Cadence and Temporal

Cadence and Temporal are two open-source workflow orchestration platforms that are designed to simplify the development and management of complex, long-running workflows. Both platforms provide a range of features, such as task coordination, state management, and error handling, that help developers build resilient and scalable systems. Cadence and Temporal use a programming model that allows developers to define workflows as code, which makes it easy to manage and version workflows over time. Cadence and Temporal also provide a range of tools and libraries that make it easy to integrate with other systems and technologies, such as databases, messaging systems, and external APIs.

# Objective

The repository is designed to help developers understand how to build and manage long-running workflows using third-party tools such as Cadence and Temporal. It provides a range of examples and best practices for building workflows that involve multiple stages, tasks, and stakeholders. The repository also provides guidance on how to handle errors, manage state, and integrate with other systems and technologies. By simulating long workflow processes using third-party tools, developers can gain a better understanding of how to build resilient and scalable systems that can handle complex workflows.

The first step in migrating from Cadence to Temporal is to start developing a workflow using Cadence. This will give developers a baseline for comparison when migrating to Temporal. Once the workflow has been developed using Cadence, the next step is to migrate it to Temporal. During this process, developers will need to evaluate the feasibility of the migration, including any changes required to the workflow code or any potential issues with compatibility. Once the workflow has been migrated to Temporal, it can be compared against the original Cadence solution to identify any differences in functionality, performance, or scalability. This process will help developers understand the benefits and challenges of migrating from Cadence to Temporal, and ensure that they have a solid understanding of both platforms.
